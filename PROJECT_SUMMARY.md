# Fake Influencer Detector - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
Successfully created a Python-based machine learning project that detects potentially risky investment advice from social media influencers using NLP and machine learning.

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`fake_influencer_detector.py`** - Main script with model training and saving
2. **`demo.py`** - Demonstration of using the saved model
3. **`test_model.py`** - Test script to verify model functionality
4. **`requirements.txt`** - Python package dependencies
5. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
6. **`model.pkl`** - Trained and saved model (6.0KB)
7. **`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary file

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Train and save the model:**
   ```bash
   python fake_influencer_detector.py
   ```

3. **Test the saved model:**
   ```bash
   python demo.py
   ```

4. **Run comprehensive tests:**
   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Model**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features
- **Dataset**: 41 sample sentences (20 risky, 21 safe)
- **Features**: 1000 max TF-IDF features with English stop words removed
- **Accuracy**: 78% on test set, 75% on custom test cases
- **Dependencies**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
